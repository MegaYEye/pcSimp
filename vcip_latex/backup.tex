\section{Introduction}
%
This document is a template.  An electronic copy can be downloaded
from the conference website.  For questions on paper guidelines,
please contact the conference publications committee as indicated on
the conference website.  Information about final paper submission is
available from the conference website.

\section{Page Layout}

An easy way to comply with the conference paper formatting
requirements is to use this document as a template and simply type
your text into it.

\subsection{Page Layout}

Your paper must use a page size corresponding to A4 which is
210mm (8.27") wide and 279mm (11.69") long.  The margins must be
set as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item	Top = 19mm (0.75")
\item	Bottom = 43mm (1.69")
\item	Left = Right = 14.32mm (0.56")
\end{itemize}

Your paper must be in two column format with a space of 4.22mm
(0.17") between columns.

\section{Blind Review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review. 
Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work;
in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are 
known and available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing 
previous work. That is all. (But see below for techreports)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy 
Smith, it says that you are building on her work. If you are Smith and Jones, do 
not say ``as we show in [1]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [1]'' and at the end 
of the paper, include reference 1 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper:
\begin{flushleft}
\setlength{\leftskip}{.15in}
\hspace{.5in} An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.\\
In this paper we present a performance analysis of our \\
previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all \\
previously known methods. Why the previous paper \\
was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.\\

[1] Removed for blind review\\
\setlength{\leftskip}{0in}
\end{flushleft}

An example of an excellent paper:
\begin{flushleft}
\setlength{\leftskip}{.15in}
\hspace{.5in} An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.\\
In this paper we present a performance analysis of the \\
paper of Smith et al. [1], and show it to be inferior to all \\
previously known methods. Why the previous paper \\
was accepted without this analysis is beyond me. \\

[1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a \\
fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature \\
381(12), 1-213.\\
\setlength{\leftskip}{0in}
\end{flushleft}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers 
similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to 
explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
 In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission [1] as additional material and 
cite it as

\begin{flushleft}
\setlength{\leftskip}{.15in}
Authors, ``The frobnicatable foo filter,'' ACM MM 2011 \\
Submission ID 324, Supplied as additional material \\
acmmm11.pdf.\\
\setlength{\leftskip}{0in}
\end{flushleft}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, 
and refer them to a technical report. For conference submissions, the paper must stand on 
its own, and not require the reviewer to go to a techreport for further details. Thus, you 
may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in [2]''. Then submit the
techreport as additional material. Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which is widely known 
to be restricted to a single institution. For example, let’s say it’s 1969, you have solved a key 
problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the VCIP audience would like to hear about 
your solution. The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: 
How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow 
at parties'', by Zeus et al.

You can handle this paper like any other. Don’t write

``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968]. This time we tested the algorithm 
on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''. That would be silly, and would immediately 
identify the authors. Instead write the following:

\begin{flushleft}
\setlength{\leftskip}{.15in}
We describe a system for zero-g frobnication. This\\ 
system is new because it handles the following cases: A,\\
 B. Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn’t handle \\
case B properly. Ours handles it by including a foo term \\
in the bar integral.\\
...\\
The proposed system was integrated with the\\
Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon,\\
 don’t you know. It displayed the following behaviours \\
which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...\\
\setlength{\leftskip}{0in}
\end{flushleft}

As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, 
and does not explicitly name you as the authors. A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was 
written by Zeus et al., but cannot make any decision based on that guess. He or she would have to be sure 
that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B. 

FAQ: Are acknowledgements OK? No. Please omit them in the review copy and leave them for the final copy.

\subsection{Paper ID and filenames}
Authors should first submit the title, list of authors,
topic/keywords, and abstract of paper. After that, a paper ID 
will be assigned. This should be entered in the paper ID field
below the title, and used as the filename of the submitted 
paper (and any supplementary materials). This avoids 
revealing the authors' information in the filename.


\section{Page Style}
\label{sec:page style}

All paragraphs must be indented.  All paragraphs must be
justified, i.e. both left-justified and right-justified.

\subsection{Text Font of Entire Document}

The entire document should be in Times New Roman or Times font.
Type 3 fonts must not be used.  Other font types may be used if
needed for special purposes.

Recommended font sizes are shown in Table \ref{tab:font-sizes}.

\subsection{Title and Author Details}
\label{sec:title and author details}

Title must be in 24 pt Regular font.  Author name must be in 11
pt Regular font.  Author affiliation must be in 10 pt Italic.
Email address must be in 9 pt Courier Regular font.

\begin{table}[!h]

    \hline
    10        & level-1 heading  (in 	&		& level-2 heading,      \\
              & Small Caps),		&		& level-3 heading,	 \\

    \hline
    24        & title			&		&			\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{small}
\end{table}

All title and author details must be in single-column format and
must be centered.

Every word in a title must be capitalized except for short minor
words such as ``a'', ``an'', ``and'', ``as'', ``at'', ``by'', ``for'', ``from'',
``if'', ``in'', ``into'', ``on'', ``or'', ``of'', ``the'', ``to'', ``with''.

Author details must not show any professional title (e.g.
Managing Director), any academic title (e.g. Dr.) or any
membership of any professional organization (e.g. Senior
Member IEEE).

To avoid confusion, the family name must be written as the
last part of each author name (e.g. John A.K. Smith).

Each affiliation must include, at the very least, the name of
the company and the name of the country where the author is
based (e.g. Causal Productions Pty Ltd, Australia).

Email address is compulsory for the corresponding author.


\subsection{Section Headings}

No more than 3 levels of headings should be used.  All headings must
be in 10pt font.  Every word in a heading must be capitalized except
for short minor words as listed in Section \ref{sec:title and author
details}.

\subsubsection{Level-1 Heading}

A level-1 heading must be in Small Caps, centered and numbered using
uppercase Roman numerals.  For example, see heading ``\ref{sec:page
style}. Page Style'' of this document.  The two level-1 headings which
must not be numbered are ``Acknowledgment'' and ``References''.

\subsubsection{Level-2 Heading}

A level-2 heading must be in Italic, left-justified and numbered using
an uppercase alphabetic letter followed by a period.  For example, see
heading ``C. Section Headings'' above.

\subsubsection{Level-3 Heading}

A level-3 heading must be indented, in Italic and numbered with an
Arabic numeral followed by a right parenthesis. The level-3 heading
must end with a colon.  The body of the level-3 section immediately
follows the level-3 heading in the same paragraph.  For example, this
paragraph begins with a level-3 heading.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Figures and tables must be centered in the column.  Large figures and
tables may span across both columns.  Any table or figure that takes
up more than 1 column width must be positioned either at the top or at
the bottom of the page.

Graphics may be full color.  All colors will be retained on the CDROM.
Graphics must not use stipple fill patterns because they may not be
reproduced properly.  Please use only SOLID FILL colors which contrast
well both on screen and on a black-and-white hardcopy, as shown in
Fig.  \ref{fig:sample_graph}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=fig_1.eps,width=68.7mm} }
	\caption{A sample line graph using colors which contrast well both on screen and on a black-and-white hardcopy}
	\label{fig:sample_graph}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:lores-photo} shows an example of a low-resolution image
which would not be acceptable, whereas Fig.  \ref{fig:hires-photo}
shows an example of an image with adequate resolution.  Check that the
resolution is adequate to reveal the important detail in the figure.

Please check all figures in your paper both on screen and on a
black-and-white hardcopy.  When you check your paper on a
black-and-white hardcopy, please ensure that:

\begin{itemize}
\item	the colors used in each figure contrast well,
\item	the image used in each figure is clear,
\item	all text labels in each figure are legible.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=lores_photo.eps,height=64.54mm} }
	\caption{Example of an unacceptable low-resolution image}
	\label{fig:lores-photo}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=hires_photo.eps,height=64.54mm} }
	\caption{Example of an image with acceptable resolution}
	\label{fig:hires-photo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figure Captions}

Figures must be numbered using Arabic numerals.  Figure captions must
be in 8 pt Regular font.  Captions of a single line (e.g. Fig.
\ref{fig:lores-photo}) must be centered whereas multi-line captions
must be justified (e.g. Fig.  \ref{fig:sample_graph}).  Captions with
figure numbers must be placed after their associated figures, as shown
in Fig. \ref{fig:sample_graph}.

\subsection{Table Captions}

Tables must be numbered using uppercase Roman numerals.  Table
captions must be centred and in 8 pt Regular font with Small Caps.
Every word in a table caption must be capitalized except for short
minor words as listed in Section \ref{sec:title and author details}.
Captions with table numbers must be placed before their associated
tables, as shown in Table \ref{tab:font-sizes}.

\subsection{Page Numbers, Headers and Footers}

Page numbers, headers and footers must not be used.

\subsection{Links and Bookmarks}

All hypertext links and section bookmarks will be removed from
papers during the processing of papers for publication.  If you
need to refer to an Internet email address or URL in your paper,
you must type out the address or URL fully in Regular font.

\subsection{References}

The heading of the References section must not be numbered.
All reference items must be in 8 pt font.  Please
use Regular and Italic styles to distinguish different fields as
shown in the References section. Number the reference items
consecutively in square brackets (e.g. \cite{IEEEexample:book}).

When referring to a reference item, please simply use the
reference number, as in \cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume}.
Do not use �Ref. \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}� or
�Reference \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}� except at the
beginning of a sentence, e.g.  ``Reference
\cite{IEEEexample:article_typical} shows �''.  Multiple
references are each numbered with separate brackets (e.g.
\cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume},
\cite{IEEEexample:article_typical},
\cite{IEEEexample:confwithpaper}--[6]).

Examples of reference items of different categories shown in the
References section include:

\begin{itemize}
\item	example of a book in \cite{IEEEexample:book}
\item	example of a book in a series in \cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume}
\item	example of a journal article in \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}
\item	example of a conference paper in \cite{IEEEexample:confwithpaper}
\item	example of a patent in \cite{IEEEexample:uspat}
\item	example of a website in \cite{IEEEexample:IEEEwebsite}
\item	example of a web page in \cite{IEEEexample:shellCTANpage}
\item	example of a databook as a manual in \cite{IEEEexample:motmanual}
\item	example of a datasheet in \cite{IEEEexample:datasheet}
\item	example of a master's thesis in \cite{IEEEexample:masterstype}
\item	example of a technical report in \cite{IEEEexample:techreptype}
\item	example of a standard in \cite{IEEEexample:standard}
\end{itemize}

% the following command shrinks the final page to force the columns to
% be balanced.  You will need to adjust the value according to the
% appearance of your last page.  Start by setting the value to 0mm
% and slowly increase it until the columns balance.  Alternatively,
% use balance.sty to do the job.

\section{Conclusion}

The version of this template is V2.  Most of the formatting
instructions in this document have been compiled by Causal Productions
from the IEEE LaTeX style files.  Causal Productions offers both A4
templates and US Letter templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word.  The
LaTeX templates depend on the official IEEEtran.cls and IEEEtran.bst
files, whereas the Microsoft Word templates are self-contained.
Causal Productions has used its best efforts to ensure that the
templates have the same appearance.

Causal Productions permits the distribution and revision of these
templates on the condition that Causal Productions is credited in the
revised template as follows: ``original version of this template was
provided by courtesy of Causal Productions
