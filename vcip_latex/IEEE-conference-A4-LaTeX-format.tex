\subsection{Graph Signal Processing}

what's GSP and how to construct graph

\section{Problem Formulation}

Here, we describe point cloud simplification as a process of 
resampling of the point cloud: given a point cloud $P$ with 
$|P|=N$, find a point cloud $P' \subset P$ with $|P'|=M<N$.

For convenience, we represent the point cloud with $N$ points
and $K$ attributes as $X \in \mathbb R^{N \times K}$, 
where $i$th row represents the $i$th point, represented as $x_i^T$. 
Attributes can be coordinates, colors and others, $K \ge 3$.
To represent the simplified point cloud, we consider the diagonal 
matrix $\Psi$, called resampling matrix with $\Psi_{ii}=1$ if 
$x_i$ in the simplified point cloud and $\Psi_{ii}=0$ if not. 
Thus, the simplified point cloud can be represented as $\Psi X$.

Our goal is to find the optimal resampling matrix $Psi$ to keep 
most geometry features of the point cloud while keep the evenness. 
Inspired by Chen[], we use graph filter to extract features of point 
cloud and select points with higher features. We use the random walk 
Laplacian $L_0=D^{-1}L=I-D^{-1}W$ to extract features, which is a 
high-pass graph filter keeping sharp features. Thus, we can represent 
features of point cloud $X$ as $L_0X$ and the remaining features (of 
the simplified point cloud) as $\Psi L_0X$. Now we define the feature 
loss of simplification as $l_f=\Psi L_0X-L_0X$.

However, merely using random walk Laplacian will cause the unevenness 
of point cloud because edges with sharp features will be saved sound 
while the surfaces will be neglected, which will cause extreme 
unevenness. To avoid this extreme unevenness, we define a evenness 
term to control the evenness of the simplified point cloud. 

When constructing the graph, we select points within radius $r$ as 
point's neighbour. If we suppose the point cloud is even, the number 
of neighbours of each point should be approximately equal and thus, 
we can use $k$-nearest neighbours. When the point cloud is even, the 
degree of each node is approximately equal. If simplified

    \end{tabular}
    \end{small}
\end{table}

All title and author details must be in single-column format and
must be centered.

Every word in a title must be capitalized except for short minor
words such as ``a'', ``an'', ``and'', ``as'', ``at'', ``by'', ``for'', ``from'',
``if'', ``in'', ``into'', ``on'', ``or'', ``of'', ``the'', ``to'', ``with''.

Author details must not show any professional title (e.g.
Managing Director), any academic title (e.g. Dr.) or any
membership of any professional organization (e.g. Senior
Member IEEE).

To avoid confusion, the family name must be written as the
last part of each author name (e.g. John A.K. Smith).

Each affiliation must include, at the very least, the name of
the company and the name of the country where the author is
based (e.g. Causal Productions Pty Ltd, Australia).

Email address is compulsory for the corresponding author.


\subsection{Section Headings}

No more than 3 levels of headings should be used.  All headings must
be in 10pt font.  Every word in a heading must be capitalized except
for short minor words as listed in Section \ref{sec:title and author
details}.

\subsubsection{Level-1 Heading}

A level-1 heading must be in Small Caps, centered and numbered using
uppercase Roman numerals.  For example, see heading ``\ref{sec:page
style}. Page Style'' of this document.  The two level-1 headings which
must not be numbered are ``Acknowledgment'' and ``References''.

\subsubsection{Level-2 Heading}

A level-2 heading must be in Italic, left-justified and numbered using
an uppercase alphabetic letter followed by a period.  For example, see
heading ``C. Section Headings'' above.

\subsubsection{Level-3 Heading}

A level-3 heading must be indented, in Italic and numbered with an
Arabic numeral followed by a right parenthesis. The level-3 heading
must end with a colon.  The body of the level-3 section immediately
follows the level-3 heading in the same paragraph.  For example, this
paragraph begins with a level-3 heading.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Figures and tables must be centered in the column.  Large figures and
tables may span across both columns.  Any table or figure that takes
up more than 1 column width must be positioned either at the top or at
the bottom of the page.

Graphics may be full color.  All colors will be retained on the CDROM.
Graphics must not use stipple fill patterns because they may not be
reproduced properly.  Please use only SOLID FILL colors which contrast
well both on screen and on a black-and-white hardcopy, as shown in
Fig.  \ref{fig:sample_graph}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=fig_1.eps,width=68.7mm} }
	\caption{A sample line graph using colors which contrast well both on screen and on a black-and-white hardcopy}
	\label{fig:sample_graph}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:lores-photo} shows an example of a low-resolution image
which would not be acceptable, whereas Fig.  \ref{fig:hires-photo}
shows an example of an image with adequate resolution.  Check that the
resolution is adequate to reveal the important detail in the figure.

Please check all figures in your paper both on screen and on a
black-and-white hardcopy.  When you check your paper on a
black-and-white hardcopy, please ensure that:

\begin{itemize}
\item	the colors used in each figure contrast well,
\item	the image used in each figure is clear,
\item	all text labels in each figure are legible.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=lores_photo.eps,height=64.54mm} }
	\caption{Example of an unacceptable low-resolution image}
	\label{fig:lores-photo}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\psfig{figure=hires_photo.eps,height=64.54mm} }
	\caption{Example of an image with acceptable resolution}
	\label{fig:hires-photo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figure Captions}

Figures must be numbered using Arabic numerals.  Figure captions must
be in 8 pt Regular font.  Captions of a single line (e.g. Fig.
\ref{fig:lores-photo}) must be centered whereas multi-line captions
must be justified (e.g. Fig.  \ref{fig:sample_graph}).  Captions with
figure numbers must be placed after their associated figures, as shown
in Fig. \ref{fig:sample_graph}.

\subsection{Table Captions}

Tables must be numbered using uppercase Roman numerals.  Table
captions must be centred and in 8 pt Regular font with Small Caps.
Every word in a table caption must be capitalized except for short
minor words as listed in Section \ref{sec:title and author details}.
Captions with table numbers must be placed before their associated
tables, as shown in Table \ref{tab:font-sizes}.

\subsection{Page Numbers, Headers and Footers}

Page numbers, headers and footers must not be used.

\subsection{Links and Bookmarks}

All hypertext links and section bookmarks will be removed from
papers during the processing of papers for publication.  If you
need to refer to an Internet email address or URL in your paper,
you must type out the address or URL fully in Regular font.

\subsection{References}

The heading of the References section must not be numbered.
All reference items must be in 8 pt font.  Please
use Regular and Italic styles to distinguish different fields as
shown in the References section. Number the reference items
consecutively in square brackets (e.g. \cite{IEEEexample:book}).

When referring to a reference item, please simply use the
reference number, as in \cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume}.
Do not use �Ref. \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}� or
�Reference \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}� except at the
beginning of a sentence, e.g.  ``Reference
\cite{IEEEexample:article_typical} shows �''.  Multiple
references are each numbered with separate brackets (e.g.
\cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume},
\cite{IEEEexample:article_typical},
\cite{IEEEexample:confwithpaper}--[6]).

Examples of reference items of different categories shown in the
References section include:

\begin{itemize}
\item	example of a book in \cite{IEEEexample:book}
\item	example of a book in a series in \cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume}
